There is currently no release. The first release will be 
0.01a and the goals of the release are limited CRUD functionality. 

As of 6/20/2010 the following exists ...

(1) basic select support
(2) basic update support (no array field support yet)

I am hoping to get insert/delete done in the upcoming week.
